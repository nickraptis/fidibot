"""
Base classes for fidibot modules.

Terminology
-----------
A Module class acts as a dispatcher and state keeper for the module.
It is basically a factory for Context objects.
Add in it whatever you wish to keep between events.

A Context on the other hand is the actual workhorse of the module.
It is stateless and a new instance is made for each event.

For specifics, look at each of the classes documentation.

Making a new module
-------------------
- Subclass one of the base Context classes.
  BaseCommandContext is handy for command based operations.
  
- Subclass BaseModule.
  Most of the time all you need to do is override its
  `context_class` attribute to point to your Context subclass.
  
- Set a file level attribute named `module` that points to
  your Module subclass.

For an example, look at the `basiccmds` module.
